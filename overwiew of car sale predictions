Sales Prediction Using Machine Learning
This project is a comprehensive machine learning solution to predict product sales based on factors like advertising expenditure, target audience segmentation, and advertising platform selection. Sales prediction is essential for businesses to forecast trends, optimize marketing strategies, and maximize revenue.

Project Overview
The objective of this project is to develop an accurate and efficient sales prediction model using Python. The workflow includes:

Data Analysis: Understanding and preprocessing the dataset.
Feature Engineering: Standardizing numerical data and encoding categorical variables.
Model Building: Training and evaluating a RandomForestRegressor for predictions.
Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²).
Deployment Preparation: Saving the model pipeline for future use.
Features
Preprocessing Pipeline: Automated standardization and one-hot encoding of features.
Machine Learning Model: Uses Random Forest Regressor for robust and flexible predictions.
Results Export: Saves predictions and trained models for easy reproducibility.
Scalable Code: Modular pipeline design for easy customization and scalability.
Dataset
The dataset includes factors influencing sales, such as:

Advertising Expenditure: Budget spent on marketing campaigns.
Target Audience Segmentation: The demographic or psychographic characteristics of the target audience.
Advertising Platform: Channels like social media, TV, or print media.
Columns:
Input Features:
advertising_expenditure: Numerical
target_audience_segment: Categorical
advertising_platform: Categorical
Target:
sales: Numerical
Note: Adjust column names as per the dataset used.

Project Workflow
Data Loading:
